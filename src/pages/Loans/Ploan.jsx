          <p class="mt-2 text-blue-800">Personal loan is a short to medium term unsecured loan granted to an individual. It has no end use restriction except for speculative purposes. Thus, one can avail personal loan for meeting wedding, education, travel or home renovation expenses; for purchasing consumer durables, two wheelers or second-hand vehicles; etc. Flexibility of usage, minimal documentation and quick processing make personal loan a preferred financing option. Unlike other loans, it usually has a shorter repayment tenure ranging from 1-5 years. Depending upon the individual applicant's profile and lender, the APR (Annual Percentage Rate) of a personal loan may vary from 11.29% to 35%. </p>
